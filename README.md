# PostgreSQL CRUD

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Node.js, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize ORM. The primary goal of the project was to create a robust and efficient system for managing data in a PostgreSQL database with a Node.js backend.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Used for building the backend server and handling HTTP requests.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database used for data storage and management.
- **Sequelize ORM**: An Object-Relational Mapping tool used to interact with the PostgreSQL database in an efficient and scalable manner.

<!-- ## Features
// - **Create**: Functionality to add new records to the PostgreSQL database.
- **Read**: Ability to retrieve and display records from the database.
- **Update**: Capability to modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete**: Functionality to remove records from the database.

## Project Structure
- **Server**: The Node.js server handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate handlers.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used to store and manage application data.
- **ORM**: Sequelize is used to define models and interact with the PostgreSQL database in a seamless manner.
